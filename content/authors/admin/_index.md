I find creative ways to bring ideas to life. At Rice University, I am currently a doctoral student in Bioengineering. My experience in a variety of biotechnology fields including biomaterials, diagnostics, and application design has helped strengthen my desire to expand healthcare access. 

I am currently working on developing a CRISPR-Cas HIV based lateral flow strip diagnostic test. I have previously collaborated with research institutions like the Rice 360 Global Health Institute and the Liu Idea Lab for Innovation & Entrepreneurship to bring a cancer diagnostic application to rural communities in Brazil. I have also worked in industry with companies such as Cepheid as an Innovation Systems Engineer to bring diagnostic assays to market for use in a variety of medical settings.

I hope to expand the boundaries of healthcare and am always on the lookout for new opportunities.
